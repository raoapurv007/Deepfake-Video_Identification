# Deepfake-Video_Identification
  Our project is a Deep learning project which is a sub branch of Artificial Intelligence
 and deals with the human brain inspired neural network technology. Computer vi
sion plays an important role in our project. It helps in processing the video and
 frames with the help of Open-CV. A PyTorch trained model is a classifier to classify
 the source video as deepfake or pristine
